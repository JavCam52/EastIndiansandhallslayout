    <h2>Mr. Hall’s Arrival to Belize:</h2>
    <p>
      It all started with Mr. George Hall who was born in Jamaica, adopted by a British couple and raised there. George Hall and his father migrated to Belize City where his father unfortunately passed away. He then went back to Jamaica where he met an East Indian woman and married her. Then, he came back to Belize City with his spouse and made his way to Corozal Town. They settled in the town and had a son named William Hall who later married a Belizean woman. The intermarriage of William Hall with a Belizean woman exemplifies the blending of cultures and the integration of the Hall family in Belizean society. This has contributed to the unique cultural landscape of Belize, where several ethnic groups have interacted with each other over generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is how the Hall’s descent came to be present in the country of Belize. Up to today, there is a well-known part of the Hall family settlement known as “Hall’s Layout.” The fact that it is still recognized today speaks to the lasting impact of this family and their role in the development of Corozal Town. As Belizean Ethnic Groups stated on their site, “The East Indians presently make up about three percent of Belize’s population” (<a href="https://www.belmopanonline.com/belize-east-indian-culture#:~:text=Their%20own%20native%20dance%2C%20the,terms%20of%20marriage%20and%20culture" target="_blank">Belize Ethnic Groups | East Indians</a>). This statistic highlights that even though they are a minor group, their contributions and presence are significant enough to be recognized as a distinct ethnic group in Belizean society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. George Hall’s wife, who is of East Indian descent, reflects a broader historical pattern in East Indian migration to the Caribbean and Central America, including Belize. Historically, many East Indians were brought to British Caribbean countries as indentured servants following the abolition of slavery in the 19th century. Some of their descendants later migrated to neighboring countries seeking opportunities. The Hall family portrays this historical movement, with families and individuals moving across the region and eventually establishing roots in Belize.
    </p>

    <h2>Evolution of Hall’s Layout Land:</h2>
    <h3>What usage does this land contain?</h3>
    <p>
      Hall’s Layout is named after an East Indian, George Hall. This East Indian settlement is still well known as Hall’s Layout, though it is now used for a different purpose. According to Mr. Steven Hall (Interview, 2025), the initial purpose of this land was for plantation. It was George Hall’s business where he cultivated all types of crops and sold them in different places. He grew coconuts, plantains, oranges, mangoes, grapefruits, and pears. The crops were sold in Chetumal, Corozal, and Belize City. This land has now turned into a thriving community with homes, parks, and accessible businesses.

    <h2>The Halls Family Culinary Tradition:</h2>
    <p>
      The legacy of Mr. Hall's Layout in Corozal stands as a cherished family heritage—a place where his descendants have not only settled but also nurtured and carried on their cultural traditions. Its community holds deep historical significance, mirroring the East Indian arrival and settlement in Belize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generations of the Hall family have preserved and adapted recipes that reflect distinct culinary traditions, offering both history and cultural identity. As Belizehubstaff (2024) states, “They have not lost touch with the ingredients and recipes that their ancestors knew.” Spices and dishes such as tacari, roti, dahl, rice, and cabbage continue to define their cuisine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the East Indian community, preparing and sharing traditional dishes—often infused with local Belizean ingredients—serves as a powerful and sensory connection to their past. A group member, Jiselle Babb, shared that her uncle, who lives in the U.S., always prepares East Indian meals for his family when he visits, keeping these culinary traditions alive and well.
