    <h2>Mr. Hall’s arrival to Belize:</h2>
    <div class="d">
        <p>It all started with Mr. George Hall who was born in Jamaica, adopted by a British couple and raised there. George Hall and his father migrated to Belize City where his father unfortunately passed away. He then went back to Jamaica where he met an East Indian woman and married her, then he came back to Belize City with his spouse and made his way to Corozal Town. They settled in the town and had a son named William Hall who later married a Belizean woman. The intermarriage of William Hall with a Belizean woman exemplifies the blending of cultures and the integration of the Hall family in Belizean society. This has contributed to the unique cultural landscape of Belize, where several ethnic groups have interacted with each other over generations. This is how the Hall’s descent came about to be present in the country of Belize and up until date there is a great part of the Hall’s family known as “Hall’s Layout” the fact that it is still known today speaks to the lasting impact of this family and their role in the development of Corozal Town. As Belizean ethnic Groups stated in their site “the East Indians presently make up about three percent of Belize’s population” ( Belize Ethnic Groups | East Indians, n.d.-a), this statistics highlights that even though they are a minor group their contributions and presence are significant enough to be recognized as a distinct ethnic group in Belizean society. Also Mr. George Hall’s wife who is from East Indian descent would have played a larger historical pattern in the East Indian migration to the Caribbean and Central America including Belize. Historically it is known that many East Indians were brought to British Caribbean countries as indentured servants following the abolition slavery in the 19th century where some of their descendants later migrated to neighbouring countries seeking opportunities. The Hall’s family portrays the historical movement with families and individuals moving across the region eventually establishing roots in Belize.</p>

        <h2>Evolution of Hall’s Layout land:</h2>
        <h3>What usage does this land contain?</h3>
<p>Hall’s Layout is named after an East Indian, George Hall. This East Indian settlement is still well known as Hall’s Layout though it is used for a different purpose. According to Mr. Steven Hall (Interview, 2025) the initial purpose of this land was for plantation. It was Greorge Hall’s business where he cultivated all types of crops and sold them in different places. He grew coconuts, plantains, oranges, mango, grape fruits and pears.The crops were sold in chetumal, Corozal and Belize City. This land has now turned into a community. It is the land of many people who have built a home and a community. It is a peaceful area with many accessible businesses, parks, and homes.</p>

        </P>
        <h2>The Halls Family Culinary Tradition:</h2>
        <p>The legacy of Mr. Hall's Layout in Corozal stands as a cherished family heritage, a place where his descendants have not only settled but also nurtured and carried on their cultural tapestry. Its community holds deep historical significance, recording its own evolution alongside the East Indian arrival and settlement in Belize. With generations of the Hall family having preserved and adapted recipes of distinct culinary traditions which create a gastronomic heritage offering tasteful history and cultural identity to the family descendants. East Indians have several dishes they prepare as part of their traditions as Belizehubstaff (2024) mentions “they have not lost touch with the ingredients and recipes that their ancestors knew.” The article further mentions some spices and food they prepare such as the tacari, roti, dahl, rice and cabbage. Within the East Indian community, the preparation and sharing of traditional dishes, often infused with local Belizean ingredients such as rice and cabbage, serve as a powerful and sensory connection to their past. Our group member’s (Jiselle Babb) uncle lives in the US but whenever he comes to visit his family members he practices his tradition and prepares them East Indian food this clearly shows how recipes were passed down through generations offering a delicious glimpse into their cultural roots.</p>
